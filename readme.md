Concrete Skateboard Shop Website

https://concreteskateshop.ca/

### About:
This is a custom WordPress theme website for a concept skate shop company called Concrete Skateboard Shop.


### Approach:
I used the [Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/) plugin to create user-entry points in the back-end of the PHP-based CMS, allowing the content manager to edit everything from the relative content blocks on the front-end interface. This includes product/brand images, product prices, external links, and text blocks for each section.

Bootstrap is incorporated for responsive page styling and layout, and jQuery plugin libraries [Owl Carousel](https://owlcarousel2.github.io/OwlCarousel2/) and [Magnific Popup](https://dimsemenov.com/plugins/magnific-popup/) for added interactive UI and UX.
